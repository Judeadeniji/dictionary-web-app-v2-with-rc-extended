# Dictionary web app solution

This is a solution to the [Dictionary web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
I've taken this Frontend Mentor app to be the perfect fit as a proof of concept for RC-Extended
